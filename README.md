My name is Kyle Cochran. This is my first time using a version control software, and I'm excited to figure these things out.

I'm a pos-baccalaureate researcher at the NIH in the Laboratory of Genetics and Genomics doing research that focuses on how circular RNA are involved in Alzheimer's Disease pathology. I hope to use the skills I'm acquiring to further that and other research conducted by my lab.

I also love playing music (specifically singing and piano) and I've just taken up cycling as a new hobby!
